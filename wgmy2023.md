# Wargames.my 2023 - Writeup
A year had passed since my [last participation](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/blob/master/wgmy2022.md) in wgmyCTF so this is my fourth wgmyCTF all time, and the second time in student category.
The quality of challenge improved a lot this year. With just right difficulties and almost no guessy challenges, it was a well organised CTF.

I am going by the team of `GPT-110` this time, with old and new friends. Our rank is a little lower than last year but it was still a good experience nevertheless.
Many of the challenges are multi-stage, with rabbit holes waiting to trap us players. I'd say they're quite tricky but I guess it was a chance for me to learn to be patience, as many times I took a few hours just to solve a challenge.

### Warmup - Web
> Let's warm up! http://warmup.wargames.my

#### Getting the Password
To get the password, we can first set a breakpoint on the `onclick` handler of the button. Tracing the call down to an object referenced in an if statement reveals the correct password it's comparing to.

Password: `this_password_is_so_weak_i_can_crack_in_1_sec!`

#### Discovering LFI
After entering the correct password, a success alert box is shown with a text that reads `Here's your flag`. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the text is read from a web API `api/4aa22934982f984b8a0438b701e8dec8.php?x=flag_for_warmup.php`.

Since changing the `x` parameter to `../../../etc/passwd` reveals the passwd file, we can confirm this is a LFI vulnerability.

#### Exploitation
The text hints that the flag is likely hidden within the comment of the php file, so we need to find a way to read the php source code. Based on experience, php supports [many kinds of stream filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php) that can tamper with input file before they're returned to the reader. <br>
Several basic attempts showed that the most common filters are blocked by a word blacklist. With multiple trial and error, it's found that the `zlib.defalte` filter is not blocked. So we employ it to modify our file stream and get the php file back in zlib compressed form.

After we got it, we can run a php instance to decode it using the `zlib_decode` function, and get the flag.

This challenge is filled with many rabbit holes. After many hours of frustration, I noticed that in line 55, the string is concatenated before it is used with format function to format. Double substitution in this order is a template for a format string vulnerability.<br>
Therefore by substituting `image_path` with `{0.__init__.__globals__}` we get all global variables which contain the flag.

### My First AI Project

To start off, we leak the app source code by loading the source code as "model", where the handy preview function shows us the file content.<br>
In the source code, we can see that the upload function is actually implemented partially, and we can upload files to the server despite not being able to train with valid datasets. Also in the function that loads a model, the `np.load` function is explicitly configured to allow pickles, which is an insecure deserialisation format.<br>
By using this, we can upload a malicious pickle file in `.csv` extension to the server then load it using the load model function. The malicious pickle file can be used to rename the flag file name to bypass the waf, then we can easily read the flag.

### Warmup - Game
> It's cold, we need to warmup

A Unity reverse challenge. First identify the location where the game unpack its file via procmon, get the game files, then use UABE to find the true scene and read the flag from the text game object.

### Compromised
> Where aRe you?

Searching `Cache0000.bin` reveals the cache vulnarability. [A script](https://github.com/Viralmaniar/Remote-Desktop-Caching-/blob/master/rdpcache.ps1) is employed to extract the cache images then we use that to guess the password and decompress the zip file.

### N-less RSA
> Endless RSA?

A [similar](https://ctftime.org/writeup/33119) writeup was found. By modifying it with the appropriate parameters we get the flag.

### Linux Memory Usage
[*Back to top*](#table-of-contents)

To solve this problem, we need to build a tree-like structure representing the relationships between processes and their parents. Then, for each query, calculate the total memory usage of the specified process and all its descendants.

```cpp
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_memory_usage(process_id, process_tree, process_memory):
    total_memory = process_memory[process_id]

    for child_id in process_tree[process_id]:
        total_memory += calculate_memory_usage(child_id, process_tree, process_memory)

    return total_memory

def main():
    # Input reading
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    process_tree = defaultdict(list)
    process_memory = {}

    for _ in range(N):
        pid, ppid, mem = map(int, input().split())
        process_tree[ppid].append(pid)
        process_memory[pid] = mem

    # Process queries
    for _ in range(Q):
        query_pid = int(input())
        total_memory = calculate_memory_usage(query_pid, process_tree, process_memory)
        print(total_memory)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**But time limit exceeds!**

Since it did not set limit according to language, so I optimize the program by storing the total memory usage for each process during the tree traversal and avoiding redundant calculations and rewrite it using C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

unordered_map<int, vector<int>> process_tree;
unordered_map<int, int> process_memory;
unordered_map<int, int> memo;

int calculate_memory_usage(int process_id) {
    if (memo.find(process_id) != memo.end()) {
        return memo[process_id];
    }

    int total_memory = process_memory[process_id];

    for (int child_id : process_tree[process_id]) {
        total_memory += calculate_memory_usage(child_id);
    }

    memo[process_id] = total_memory;
    return total_memory;
}

int main() {
    // Input reading
    int N, Q;
    cin >> N >> Q;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int pid, ppid, mem;
        cin >> pid >> ppid >> mem;
        process_tree[ppid].push_back(pid);
        process_memory[pid] = mem;
    }

    // Process queries
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) {
        int query_pid;
        cin >> query_pid;
        int total_memory = calculate_memory_usage(query_pid);
        cout << total_memory << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Then, we did it!
